# oit_minesweeper

A basic minesweeper game using pygame. Includes capability to uncover squares with a left click and mark potential bombs with a right click.

This is built based on two tutorials found through FreeCodeCamp: Kylie Ying's [Minesweeper tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fjw7Lc9zlyU) and Keith Galli's [Connect Four tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpYz-q1lxu8). I took the basic functionality of the minesweeper program from the former, created an interactive pygame window based on the instructions in the latter, and added the functionality to mark bombs.

I coded this as one of multiple mini-projects during [Out in Tech](https://outintech.com/)'s fall 2022 mentorship program. I chose this project to gain practice with object-oriented programming and creating a basic front-end application.
